# How does StarBase Wallet work?

- StarBase Wallet is like a browser for blockchains. Via StarBase wallet you can interact with blockchains, see your balance of funds stored on blockchain.
- No crypto is stored on StarBase Wallet itself. That's not how it works. All the funds are stored on blockchain. StarBase gives you access to them.
- StarBase Wallet is free to download and does not earn anything when you use it.Â Fees are all paid to the miners or validators of crypto networks.
- StarBase Wallet helps you interact with blockchain, in order to send and receive cryptos.
